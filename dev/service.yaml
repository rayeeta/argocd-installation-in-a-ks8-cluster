#This Kubernetes Service YAML defines a Service for an application called myapp-service. Let’s break it down step by step.

#1. API Version and Kind

#apiVersion: v1
#kind: Service
#apiVersion: v1 → This specifies that the resource is a Service, which is part of the core Kubernetes API (v1).
#kind: Service → Defines this resource as a Service, which is used to expose a set of Pods over a network.
#2. Metadata

#metadata:
 # name: myapp-service
#name: myapp-service → The name of the Service, which can be used to reference it within the cluster.
#3. Specification (spec)
#This section defines how the Service will work.

#  selector:
#    app: myapp
#selector: app: myapp → This Service will select and route traffic to Pods that have the label app: myapp.
#This must match the labels of the Pods defined in the Deployment.
#Ports

#  ports:
#  - port: 8080
#    protocol: TCP
#    targetPort: 8080
#ports → Specifies which ports the Service exposes.
#port: 8080 → The Service listens on port 8080.
#protocol: TCP → Uses the TCP protocol (default).
#targetPort: 8080 → The traffic received on port: 8080 will be forwarded to port 8080 inside the Pods.
#How It Works
#This Service will discover all Pods with the label app: myapp.
#It will route traffic from port: 8080 on the Service to targetPort: 8080 on the Pods.
#The Pods themselves must have an application listening on port 8080.
#This enables internal communication within the cluster.
#Additional Enhancements
#You can modify this Service to make it accessible externally:

#For ClusterIP (Default)
#The Service is only accessible inside the cluster (default behavior).
#For NodePort (Expose to external users)

#  type: NodePort
#  ports:
#  - port: 8080
#    targetPort: 8080
#    nodePort: 30080
#This exposes the Service on a specific port (30080) on every node.
#For LoadBalancer (Expose on the Cloud)

#  type: LoadBalancer
#This is used in cloud environments (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) to assign a public external IP.
#Summary
#Defines a Service named myapp-service.
#Routes traffic to Pods labeled app: myapp.
#Listens on port 8080 and forwards traffic to the same port in the Pods.
#Default type is ClusterIP (internal access only).
